    <h1>Projects:</h1>
    <br></br>

    <h2>C++/C</h2>
    
    <h4>Assembly Language and other related Architecture Projects</h4>
    <p> Created a program that implements an assembly language simulator </p>          
    <p> Made a linker for making assembly files into object files of machine code</p>          
    <p> Implemented a cycle-accurate behavioral simulator for a pipelined implementation of assembly language, with data forwarding and simple branch prediciton </p? 
    <p> Designed a cache simulator</p>       
    <br></br>
    
    <h4>Mine Escape and Searching, PQ Definer</h4>
    <p>Created a mine escape game- it begins by generating a starting grid with weighted tiles containing different amounts of rubble and randomized TNT placements</p>
    <p>The miner escapes by blasting out through the most optimal path (taking into consideration rubble values, paths that maybe aren't locally optimal but lead to TNT tiles/ chain reactions later on and clear more tiles, etc.) on a constantly evolving grid</p>       
    <p>Utilized data structures including priority queues of vectors with custom comparator </p> 
    <br></br>

    <h4>Letterman</h4>
    <p> Created a Letterman project that takes in any user input start word to change into an input end word </p>
    <p> One letter is changed at a time through insert, delete, swap, or change, with the position of the modification depending on whether it matches a word in the generated dictionary ( users can choose simple or complex- which special symbols can be attached to a list of words to generate more words: some symbols depending on their placement mean to generate all words that can be formed from reversing the word, swapping certain characters, repeating certain letters, etc.)</p>
    <p> Utilized stack, queue, and deques of structs</p>       
    <br></br>

    <h4>Relational Databases</h4>
    <p> Created a program emulating different features of relational databases with an overall interface based on SQL</p>
    <p> Utilized data structure including hash maps, binary search trees, functors, comparators</p>       
    <br></br>


    <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
    <p> Created a C++ program that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automatically identify the subjects of Piazza posts </p>          
    <p> Integrated the map data structure and binary search trees to build a classifier that assumes a probabilistic model of how posts are composed, and predicts the label by computing the log-probability score</p>          
    <p> Read in and processed CSV files as input for training the classifier</p>   
    <p> Essentially a simplified version of the Multi-Variate Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier</p>       
    <br></br>

    <h4>Web Development- Office hour Queue</h4>
    <p> Built a web server for an office hours queue</p>          
    <p> Designed the top-level application as a REST API that reads and writes an HTTP subset on stdin and stdout to simulate a constantly evolving queue of students</p>          
    <p>  Utilized C++, linked lists for FIFO order, and a Python wrapper script to run the server on a web browser</p>   
    <br></br>

    <h4>Euchre</h4>
    <p> Created a program that can simulate a complete game of Euchre between four players, and also allows human players to play against CPU players.</p>          
    <p> Takes into account each playerâ€™s cards, making trump, partnerships, winning tricks, and game strategies for the CPU players.</p>          
    <br></br>

    <h4>Content-Aware Image Resizing</h4>
    <p> Developed a program that implements parts of the seam carving algorithm to support content-aware image resizing.</p>          
    <p> Computed energy matrices, finding paths to calculate cost matrices, and finding and removing seams. </p>          
    <p> Worked with reading and writing images in PPM format</p>
    <br></br>


    <h2>Python/web</h2>

    <h4>Music quiz</h4>
    <p> Developed a music quiz website mimicking the click wheel iPod </p>
    <p>Included environment setup with shell script, Google Firebase, web-scraping to display artist info, concert dates, and Youtube videos, social media sharing capabilities</p>          
    <br></br>

    <h4>Planfly</h4>
    <p> Developed a personal website with a planner web application and portfolio section (which you are seeing now!)</p>
    <p> Features security through a login system, an interactive events calendar, a to-do list, two notebook features, and schedule-upload. </p>
    <p>Utilized Google Firebase for real-time data syncing, and Firebase Authentication to create a signup/login system</p>          
    <br></br>

    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p> Programmed with Java for database management, commercial applications and games such as Paymaster, Apartment Finder, Shapes Program and Bulgarian Solitaire, mouse in maze, "sudoku"</p>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
